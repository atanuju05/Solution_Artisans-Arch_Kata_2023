# Solution_Artisans-Arch_Kata_2023

A new startup wants to build the next generation online trip management dashboard to allow travelers to see all of their existing reservations organized by trip either online (web) or through their mobile device.
• Users: 2 million active users/week 
     total users: 15 million (user accounts)
• Requirements:
•	Poll email looking for travel-related emails
•	Filter and whitelist certain emails
•	The system must interface with the agency’s existing airline, hotel, and car rental interface system to update travel details (delays, cancellations, updates, gate changes, etc.). Updates must be in the app within 5 minutes of an update (better than the competition)
•	Customers should be able to add, update, or delete existing reservations manually as well.
•	Provide end-of-year summary reports for users with a wide range of metrics about their travel
•	Usage  Road Warrior gathers analytical data from users trips for various purposes - travel trends, locations, airline and hotel vendor preferences, cancellation and update frequency, and so on.

Additional Context
•	must integrate seamlessly with existing travel systems (i.e, SABRE, APOLLO)
•	Must integrate with preferred travel agency for quick problem resolution (help me!)
•	must work internationally
