## The C4 model

- Once we had our Actor-Action approach defined we got the basic building blocks ready for the system.
- Then we had our Architecture Analysis which led us to event driven Microservice architecture.
- We followed the C4 model to come up with the Context, Container and Component diagrams.
- The class diagram we felt is too granular and goes more into the design aspects, hence, we did not create those. But those can be created easily.
- Next, we shall delve into the different diagrams.
